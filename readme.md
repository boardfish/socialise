# Socialise - a simple site for the social

Socialise is a simple site for even the less web-savvy. Just find links to your profiles for each social network you want to go public, and the rest is done for you. If you've got an inkling about what to do with web development, Socialise is a minimal template for you to work off - great for first timers. And if you haven't...it's as simple as this.

## Installation

1. **Fork** this project to your GitHub account using the Fork button up top.

1. In the settings for your fork, **rename the project** to `yourusername.github.io`, where `yourusername` is your GitHub username. From then on, Socialise will be live at that web address, `yourusername.github.io`.

1. **In your fork of the project, change the lines beginning with `assign` in the file `index.html`**. Replace what's in the quotes with what's at the end of your profile links. For example, if you view your personal Facebook profile, your browser will be at `facebook.com/your.username` or something like that. In this case, put `your.username` between the quotes. If you don't have an account for a shown service, simply delete that line or surround that line with `{% comment %}` and `{% endcomment %}`.

You can also **deploy with Heroku** - instructions available soon. 

I'll admit that right now this is a little heavy-handed, but relatively speaking, it's still far less of an investment of time (or money!) than most people would put into making a website.
